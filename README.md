Generate interactive dependency graphs for C# projects and classes directly from Visual Studio Code.

![C# Dependency Graph](images/dependency-graph-preview.png)

## Features

- **Project-level dependency visualization**: See how your C# projects depend on each other
- **Class-level dependency analysis**: Analyze dependencies between classes across your solution
- **Customizable output**: Configure which elements to include in your dependency graph
- **Exclude test projects**: Option to exclude test projects from the analysis
- **DOT file output**: Generate standard DOT files for use with Graphviz or other visualization tools

## Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "C# Dependency Graph"
4. Click Install

### Manual Installation

1. Download the .vsix file from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/vscode-csharp-dependency-graph/releases)
2. In VS Code, go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Click on the "..." menu (top-right) and select "Install from VSIX..."
4. Select the downloaded .vsix file

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.60.0 or higher
- A C# project (typically a .NET solution with .csproj files)

## Usage

### Generating a Dependency Graph

1. Open a folder containing C# projects in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
3. Type "C#: Generate Dependency Graph" and select the command
4. Choose the type of dependency graph:
   - **Project Dependencies**: Shows relationships between projects
   - **Class Dependencies**: Shows detailed relationships between classes
5. Select where to save the .dot file
6. The graph will be generated and saved to the specified location

### Viewing the Graph

You can view the generated .dot file using:

- VS Code extensions like [Graphviz Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EFanZh.graphviz-preview)
- Online tools like [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)
- Desktop applications like [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)

### Example Class Dependency Graph

Here's an example of a class dependency graph generated by the extension:

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `csharpDependencyGraph.includeNetVersion`: Include .NET framework version in project nodes
* `csharpDependencyGraph.excludeTestProjects`: Exclude test projects from the dependency graph
* `csharpDependencyGraph.testProjectPatterns`: Glob patterns to identify test projects
* `csharpDependencyGraph.includeClassDependencies`: Include class-level dependencies in the graph
* `csharpDependencyGraph.excludeSourcePatterns`: Glob patterns for source files to exclude from analysis

## How It Works

The extension works by:

1. Finding all .csproj files in the workspace
2. Parsing the project files to extract project references
3. For class-level analysis, parsing all C# files to extract class dependencies including:
   - Inheritance relationships
   - Field and property types
   - Method parameter and return types
   - Static method calls
   - Object instantiations
4. Generating a DOT file representation of the dependency graph

## Known Issues

- Very large codebases with many classes may generate complex graphs that are difficult to render
- Some complex C# syntax constructs might not be correctly parsed for class dependencies
- The extension currently only analyzes direct project references in .csproj files, not transitive package references

## Release Notes
